You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the
site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most
common way is to run `hydejs serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates
your site when a file is updated.

HydeJS requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and
`MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that,
include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an
idea about how it works.

HydeJS also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %} def print_hi(name) puts "Hi, #{name}" end print_hi('Tom') #=>
prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT. {% endhighlight %}
